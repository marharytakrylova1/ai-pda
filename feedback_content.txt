Should AI Be Involved In My Medical Care?
Artificial intelligence, or AI, is being used more and more in healthcare. It helps doctors and nurses take
notes, make decisions, and plan treatments. AI can be helpful, but it is not perfect. It can make mistakes,
leave out information, or be biased (unfair). Because of this, it is important for you to know when and
how AI is used for your health.
You have the right to understand how AI might affect you. You also have the right to decide if you want it
to be part of your care and how much it should be used. This tool takes about 10 minutes to finish. It will
help you learn the facts, think about what matters most to you, and make the choices that feel right.
How to Use This Tool:
1. Follow the 5 steps in order:
● Step 1: Learn the facts about AI in healthcare.
● Step 2: Show what is important to you using the sliders.
● Step 3: Take a quiz to check what you learned.
● Step 4: Make your final decision about using AI.
● Step 5: Get a summary of your answers.
2. Save or print your summary:
● Download or print your summary so you can keep a copy for yourself.
3. Use your summary in conversations:
● Share it with your doctors, family, or anyone you choose.
● You can use this document to tell your doctors exactly how you want AI used. You can ask for
full use, limited use, or no AI at all.
1. Get The Facts
Your Choices
- Agree to AI Use: Allow AI to be used for all your care.
- Pick and Choose:Allow AI for some things (like taking notes), but not others.
- Deny AI Use: Do not allow AI to be used at all.
Knowing what you want helps you stay in control of your care. Your doctor should explain the risks
and benefits of the AI tools they use, so you can make a smart choice. Even if a hospital uses AI, you
can still decide if you want it used for your care.

What is AI and How Does it Work?
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a computer tool. It looks at huge amounts of data to find patterns. It uses
these patterns to make guesses or give suggestions. Unlike a human, AI does not have feelings or
thoughts.
1
People who build AI usually follow six steps:
1. Decide what the AI should do.
2. Collect the information the AI will learn from.
3. Teach the computer to find patterns in that information.
4. Test the tool to see if it works well.
5. Start using AI to help people.
6. Keep checking the tool and update it over time.
Even though these are the best steps to follow, there are currently no laws or rules that force
companies to do them.
Common Uses of AI in Medicine

4,5
2. Supporting diagnosis and treatment choices
- Suggest what might be wrong based on your health information.
4
- Offer treatment options that follow medical recommendations.
4,6
- Predict health risks, like complications, to help doctors plan the best care.
6
3. Making medical notes and visit summaries
- Turn doctors’ or patients’ words into written visit summaries.
7–9

Benefits of AI
22
Helps Doctors Do Their Jobs
- Helps doctors think through medical problems.
- Can help with diagnosing illnesses.
- Works well for reading medical images, like X-rays.
- Can decrease human-error mistakes.
Helps Patients
- Explains medical information in simple ways.

- Can help with many languages.
- Supports more personalized care.
Saves Time and Energy
- Helps with writing medical notes.
- Makes reports, like radiology reports, easier to read,

Harms and Risks of AI
22
Accuracy Problems
- AI learns from data, which can include bias.
- Might not work well for rare or difficult cases.
- Can give answers that are partly wrong or incomplete.
- Gets less accurate with harder questions.
Missing Human Qualities
- Does not understand feelings.
- Could lead to less human involvement if overused.
- Can lead to overreliance if medical professionals assume it is correct.
- Still needs doctors to check its work.
Fairness and Access
- AI might make healthcare unfair for some people. It could make things worse for those
who do not have easy access to technology.
- If that data leaves out certain groups of people, the AI might not work well for everyone.
Privacy and Legal Concerns
- There are risks of hacking and data leaks.
- It is not always clear who is responsible if AI makes a mistake.
Summary / Key Takeaways
- AI helps doctors. It organizes notes, finds health problems, and saves time. But remember, the
doctor still makes the final decisions.
- AI has benefits. It can give faster results, explain medical facts simply, and help people who
speak different languages.
- AI has risks. It might make mistakes, be unfair (biased), or have privacy worries. That is why it is
important to ask questions about the AI tools being used.
- You have the right to choose. You can decide if and how AI is used for your health. You can agree
to full use, limited use, or no AI at all.

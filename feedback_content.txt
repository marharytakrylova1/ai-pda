Should AI Be Involved In My Medical Care? 
Artificial intelligence, or AI, is increasingly used in healthcare. It helps medical professionals with note-taking, decision-making, and treatment planning. While AI can be helpful, it can also make mistakes, provide incomplete responses, or have biases, .aFor this reason, it is important for you to know when and how it is being used in your care.

You have the right to understand how AI might affect your health and to decide if you want it to be part of your care and to what extent. This tool will take ~10 minutes to complete and will help you learn the facts, think about what matters most to you, and make choices that feel right for you in different situations.

How to Use This Tool (this should be a dropdown with steps) :
Follow the 5 steps in order:
Learn the facts about AI in healthcare.
Show your values using the sliders.
Quiz yourself to check understanding.
Make your decision about AI use.
Get your summary of all responses.
Save or print your summary.
 Download or print the summary so you can keep it for your records.
Use your summary in conversations.
 Share it with your care team, family, or anyone you choose.
 You can also use it as documentation to request full, limited, or no AI use in your care.
1. Get The Facts 
Your Choices
Agree to AI Use: Allow AI to be used for all your care.
Pick and Choose:Allow AI for some things (like taking notes), but not others.
Deny AI Use: Do not allow AI to be used at all.

Knowing what you want helps you stay in control of your care. Your doctor should explain the risks and benefits so you can make a smart choice. Even if a hospital uses AI, you can still decide if you want it used for your health.23 


What is AI and How Does it Work?
AI (Artificial Intelligence) is a computer tool that looks at large amounts of data to find patterns. It uses these patterns to make guesses or suggestions. Unlike a human, AI does not have feelings or thoughts.1

AI developers follow six general steps when creating AI: 
1) decide what AI should do,
2) gather information the AI will learn from, 
3) teach the computer to find patterns in the data, 
4) check if the tool works well, 
5) put AI into real use to help people, 
6) keep checking the tool and make updates over time. 
Although these are the best practices for developing AI tools, there are no laws or regulations to
make sure these steps are followed. 

Common Uses of AI in Medicine
AI is being used more often in healthcare.17 Here are some ways it helps doctors and patients right now: 
Helping doctors find and track health problems 
Spot early signs of sickness in lab tests or medical pictures.3,4
Read X-rays, CT scans, and other images to find issues faster.4,5
Supporting diagnosis and treatment choices
Suggest what might be wrong based on your health information.4
Offer treatment options that follow medical recommendations.4,6
Predict health risks, like complications, to help doctors plan the best care.6 
Making medical notes and visit summaries 
Turn doctors’ or patients’ words into written visit summaries.7–9
Write drafts of notes for when you leave the hospital.10,11 
Organize and update medical records quickly.10,12 
Reducing paperwork and administrative work 
Help pick the right billing and insurance codes.13 
Order tests and medicine faster..14 
Decrease time spent on forms so doctors can focus more on patients.15 
Helping patients stay organized and involved in their care

Can help with diagnosing illnesses. 
Works well for reading medical images, like X-rays.
Can decrease human-error mistakes.

Potential Harms and Risks of AI22
Accuracy Problems
AI learns from data, which can include bias.
Might not work well for rare or difficult cases.
Can give answers that are partly wrong or incomplete.
Gets less accurate with harder questions.
Missing Human Qualities
Does not understand feelings.
Could lead to less human involvement if overused.
Can lead to overreliance if medical professionals assume it is correct.
Still needs doctors to check its work.
Fairness and Access
AI might make healthcare unfair for some people. It could make things worse for those who do not have easy access to technology. 
If that data leaves out certain groups of people, the AI might not work well for everyone.
Privacy and Legal Concerns
There are risks of hacking and data leaks.
It is not always clear who is responsible if AI makes a mistake.


Summary / Key Takeaways
AI tools help doctors by organizing information, detecting health problems, and saving time, but doctors still make final decisions. 
AI has benefits, like faster results, simple explanations of medical information, support for non-English speakers, and more. 
AI also has risks, such as possible mistakes, bias, or privacy concerns, so it is important to ask questions about the AI tools being used. 
You have a right to choose if and how AI is used in your care. You can agree to full use, limited use, or none at all.

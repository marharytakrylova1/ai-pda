Should AI Be Involved In My Medical Care?
Artificial intelligence, or AI, is a tool that is seeing increased use in healthcare to help medical professionals take notes, make decisions, plan treatments, and more. While AI can be helpful, it is not perfect and it’s important for you to know when and how it is being used in your care.

You have the right to understand how AI might affect your health and to decide whether or not you want it to be part of your care. This tool will help you learn the facts, think about what matters most to you, and make choices that feel right for you in different situations.

How to Use This Tool:
1. Follow the 5 steps in order:
○ Learn the facts about AI in healthcare.
○ Show your values using the sliders.
○ Quiz yourself to check understanding.
○ Make your decision about AI use.
○ Get your summary of all responses.
2. Save or print your summary.
Download or print the summary so you can keep it for your records.
3. Use your summary in conversations.
Share it with your care team, family, or anyone you choose.
You can also use it as documentation to request full, limited, or no AI use in your care.

1. Get The Facts
Your Options
1) Agree to the use of AI in your medical care in full.
2) Request that AI tools are not used for certain aspects of your care (ex: taking notes, diagnostic help, etc).
3) Deny AI use in your care.

Some healthcare facilities let patients choose when and how AI is used in their care, but not all do. Knowing your options and how you feel about AI can help you avoid situations where tools you don’t want are used without you knowing.

What is AI?
You have probably heard about artificial intelligence, or AI, especially as it becomes more common in healthcare. AI is a type of computer technology that can learn and make decisions like a human. AI allows computers to do things that would otherwise need the human brain.

How Do AI Tools Work?
AI tools use computer programs called algorithms to find patterns in large amounts of data. They are trained on this information and learn from it to make predictions and suggestions. AI developers follow six general steps when creating AI:
1) decide what AI should do,
2) gather information the AI will learn from,
3) teach the computer to find patterns in the data,
4) check if the tool works well,
5) put AI into real use to help people,
6) keep checking the tool and make updates over time.

Common Uses of AI in Medicine
AI has been used in healthcare more and more since 2017. Below are some common ways it helps doctors and patients today:
1. Helping doctors find and monitor health problems
- Detect early signs of disease from lab results or medical images.
- Help read X-rays, CT scans, MRIs, heart tests, and other imaging results to spot issues faster.
2. Supporting diagnosis and treatment decisions
- Suggest possible diagnoses based on medical information.
- Offer treatment options that follow medical recommendations.
- Predict health risks, like complications, to help doctors plan the best care.
3. Making medical notes and visit summaries
- Turn doctors’ or patients’ speech into written visit summaries.
- Write drafts of clinical notes and hospital discharge summaries.
- Organize and update patient medical records more quickly.
4. Reducing paperwork and administrative work
- Suggest correct billing and insurance codes.
- Help order lab tests and/or medications more efficiently.
- Decrease time spent on forms so doctors can focus more on patients.
5. Helping patients stay organized and involved in their care
- Send appointment reminders and follow-up messages.
- Collect pre-visit information through virtual assistants or online forms.
- Translation of medical information for non-English speakers.
- Provide simple explanations or instructions to patients.
- Help patients manage medications and track symptoms at home.

Benefits of AI
Helps Doctors Do Their Jobs
- Gives clear and organized answers
- Helps doctors think through medical problems

Potential Harms and Risks of AI
Accuracy Problems
- AI learns from data, which can include bias
- May not work well for rare or complex cases
- Can give answers that are partly wrong or incomplete
- Gets less accurate with harder questions
- Accuracy levels can be inconsistent
Missing Human Qualities
- Does not understand feelings
- Could lead to less human involvement if overused
- Still needs doctors to check its work
Technology Challenges
- Sometimes it’s hard to know how AI makes decisions (“black box”)
- Quality of answers can change from case to case
- Hard to fit it smoothly into busy health systems
Fairness and Access
- Could make gaps worse if some groups have less access to technology
- Some groups may not be well-represented in the data AI learns from
Privacy and Legal Concerns
- There are risks of hacking and data leaks
- It is not always clear who is responsible if AI makes a mistake

Patient Rights and Choice
You should be told when AI tools are used in your care (for example diagnostics, translation, note taking, image analysis, etc.), and you should have the choice to accept or decline their use. Healthcare providers must explain what the AI tools do and what risks and benefits there are so you can decide based on full information.

Summary / Key Takeaways
- AI tools help doctors by organizing information, detecting health problems, and saving time, but doctors still make final decisions.
- AI has benefits, like faster results, simple explanations of medical information, support for non-English speakers, and more.
- AI also has risks, such as possible mistakes, bias, or privacy concerns, so it is important to ask questions about the AI tools being used.
- You have a right to choose if and how AI is used in your care. You can agree to full use, limited use, or none at all.

2. Your Feelings
Your personal comfort and priorities are just as important as the medical facts. Take a moment to think about what matters most to you, and use the sliders below to show how you feel about each statement. There are no right or wrong answers. This is about your own preferences.

Detecting Medical Problems: I want AI to help find medical problems early because I value getting the fastest, most accurate care possible. OR I prefer only a human to check my tests and scans because I value personal review and human judgment.
Diagnosis and Treatment Decisions: I want AI to help my doctor think through my diagnosis or treatment because I value having extra tools for safety and accuracy. OR I prefer my doctor to make all decisions without AI because I value human experience and trust their judgment most.
Medical Notes and Visit Summaries: I am comfortable with AI helping write or organize my visit notes because I value clear and easy-to-read information. OR I want only a human to handle my notes because I value personal control over my medical information.
Paperwork and Administrative Work: I want AI to help with forms, scheduling, and check-in because I value fast and easy visits. OR I prefer people to handle my paperwork because I value human interaction.
Virtual Assistants: I want quick and easy access to information and am okay with using an AI assistant if it gives me that. OR I prefer not to use an AI assistant because I value personal guidance and feel more comfortable speaking to a real person.
Privacy Concerns: I am okay with AI using my medical data if it can improve my care. OR I do not want any of my medical data to be used by AI.
Technical Understanding: I want AI used even if I don’t fully understand how it works. OR I prefer only using tools I completely understand, even if AI could help.
Efficiency: I value efficiency and AI tools can help make my care faster and easier. OR I would prefer slower care if it means less AI involvement.
Bias: I care about fairness and think that AI can do a good job treating all patients fairly. OR I prefer humans making decisions when fairness is important.

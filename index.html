            <h3>Should AI Be Involved In My Medical Care?</h3>
            <p>Artificial intelligence, or AI, is increasingly used in healthcare. It helps medical professionals with note-taking, decision-making, and treatment planning. While AI can be helpful, it can also make mistakes, provide incomplete responses, or have biases. For this reason, it is important for you to know when and how it is being used in your care.</p>
            <p>You have the right to understand how AI might affect your health and to decide if you want it to be part of your care and to what extent. This tool will help you learn the facts, think about what matters most to you, and make choices that feel right for you in different situations.</p>

                <h3>What is AI?</h3>
                <p>You have probably heard about artificial intelligence, or AI, especially as it becomes more common in healthcare. AI is a type of computer technology that looks at large amounts of data and predicts what is most likely to happen next. It does not think or feel like a human. Instead, it follows patterns it has learned from data to help make predictions or suggestions.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-block">
                <h3>How Do AI Tools Work?</h3>
                <p>AI tools use computer programs called algorithms to find patterns in large amounts of data. They are trained on this information and learn from it to make predictions and suggestions. AI developers follow six general steps when creating AI:</p>

                            <li>Check if the tool works well</li>
                            <li>Put AI into real use to help people</li>
                            <li>Keep checking the tool and make updates over time</li>

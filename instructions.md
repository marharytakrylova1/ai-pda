I need you to create me a simple purely html/css website that I can host on GitHub pages for a project I'm working on. The project is a patient deicsion aid that will create a digital tool that patients can use to learn about how AI is used in medicine and decide wehther they want its involvement in their medical care. THe project will provide patients with bakcground information, text their knowledge, evaluate their values, and give them a summary of where they stand on the topic of AI use to guide their medical care. An example website can be found here: https://www.healthwise.net/ohridecisionaid/Content/StdDocument.aspx?DOCHWID=aa69795 . Please make your version just like this, but make it look more modern and user friendly. Remember, make this with only html and css if possible, no javascript or frameworks. Make the search bar at the top thinner and search up key terms in the website (just where it appears). If this needs javascript to work, then feel free to add it. Use the order of items in the supplied pdf document with all the content that needs to be put on the site, not the ordering displayed in the example site.
